<p>Hola, I'm Nikshep, I was born and raised in Bangalore, India until I moved to Waterloo, Ontario in Canada to do my undergrad in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I'm currently interning at PagerDuty as a Data Science Intern in the Bay Area. In my free time I like playing some League of Legends with friends, Reading books, hanging out on Twitch, learning new stuff and watching anime.</p>
